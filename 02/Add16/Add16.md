# Instructions to Design an Add16 Gate

**Understand the Add16 Gate:**

- First, make sure you understand the functionality of an Add16 gate. The Add16 gate is a 16-bit adder that takes two 16-bit inputs (A and B) and produces a 16-bit sum (out) as the output. It performs binary addition on the two input words.

**Use the Half Adder and Full Adder:**

- Understand that the Add16 gate can be built using combinations of Half Adder and Full Adder gates. The Half Adder adds two 1-bit inputs and produces a 1-bit sum and a carry output. The Full Adder adds three 1-bit inputs (including a carry-in) and produces a 1-bit sum and a carry-out.

**Logic Expression for the Add16 Gate:**

- The logic expression for the Add16 gate is a combination of Half Adder and Full Adder logic expressions, as shown below:

    out[0] = HalfAdder(A[0], B[0]).sum

    carry[1] = HalfAdder(A[0], B[0]).carry

    out[1] = FullAdder(A[1], B[1], carry[1]).sum

    carry[2] = FullAdder(A[1], B[1], carry[1]).carry

    out[2] = FullAdder(A[2], B[2], carry[2]).sum

    carry[3] = FullAdder(A[2], B[2], carry[2]).carry

    // Continue connecting Full Adders for the remaining bit positions

    // Connect the Full Adder for the 15th bit position
    
    out[15] = FullAdder(A[15], B[15], carry[14]).sum

**Truth Table for the Add16 Gate:**

- Create a truth table for the Add16 gate, considering all possible input combinations for the 16-bit inputs (A and B). Since there are two 16-bit inputs, there will be 65536 rows in the truth table (2^16).

    |   A   |   B   |  out  |
    |-------|-------|-------|
    | 000...000 | 000...000 | 000...000 |
    | 000...000 | 000...001 | 000...001 |
    | 000...000 | 000...010 | 000...010 |
    |   ...   |   ...   |   ...   |
    | 111...111 | 111...110 | 111...101 |
    | 111...111 | 111...111 | 111...110 |

**Implementing the Add16 Gate using HDL:**

- Write the HDL code for the Add16 gate using the Half Adder and Full Adder as building blocks. Declare the two 16-bit input pins (A and B) and the one 16-bit output pin (out). Implement the required Adder chips for each bit position and connect them accordingly.

    ```hdl
    // Add16 chip using HalfAdder and FullAdder chips
    CHIP Add16 {
        IN A[16], B[16];
        OUT out[16];

        PARTS:
        // Connect Half Adder for the least significant bit
        HalfAdder(a=A[0], b=B[0], sum=out[0], carry=c0);

        // Connect Full Adders for the remaining bit positions
        FullAdder(a=A[1], b=B[1], cin=c0, sum=out[1], carry=c1);
        FullAdder(a=A[2], b=B[2], cin=c1, sum=out[2], carry=c2);
        // Continue connecting Full Adders for the remaining bit positions

        // Connect the Full Adder for the 15th bit position
        FullAdder(a=A[15], b=B[15], cin=c14, sum=out[15], carry=c15);
    }
    ```

**Test the Add16 Gate:**

- Before moving on to the next step, it's essential to test your Add16 gate implementation thoroughly. You can do this by using a hardware simulator or a hardware simulator provided by the Nand to Tetris software suite.
- Create test cases by setting different 16-bit data inputs (A and B) and observe the corresponding 16-bit sum output (out). Verify that the Add16 gate produces the correct sum based on binary addition.

    ```
    // Test script for the Add16 gate
    // Test case 1: A=0000000000000001, B=0000000000000001
    set A 0000000000000001
    set B 0000000000000001
    eval
    output out 0000000000000010 // Expected output is 2 (binary 10)

    // Test case 2: A=0000000000000000, B=1111111111111111
    set A 0000000000000000
    set B 1111111111111111
    eval
    output out 1111111111111111 // Expected output is 65535 (binary 1111111111111111)

    // Test case 3: A=0101010101010101, B=1010101010101010
    set A 0101010101010101
    set B 1010101010101010
    eval
    output out 1111111111111111 // Expected output is 65535 (binary 1111111111111111)

    // Test case 4: A=1111000011110000, B=0000111100001111
    set A 1111000011110000
    set B 0000111100001111
    eval
    output out 1111111111111111 // Expected output is 65535 (binary 1111111111111111)
    ```

**Debugging:**

- Run the test script and compare the actual output (out) with the expected output based on the test cases. If there are any discrepancies, review your HDL code for errors or logic mistakes.
- Check the connection between the Half Adder and Full Adder chips to ensure they are correct for each bit position.

Once the Add16 gate passes all test cases, you have successfully designed and implemented the 16-bit adder. Congratulations! Now, you have a critical component of your computer's central processing unit (CPU) capable of performing binary addition. Good luck with your Nand to Tetris journey!
