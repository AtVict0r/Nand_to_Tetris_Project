# Nand to Tetris Course Code

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Nand to Tetris course! Here, you'll find my code and projects as I progress through the course, building a computer from the ground up.

## About the Course
The Nand to Tetris course takes you on an exciting journey of constructing a complete computer system, starting with basic logic gates and culminating in a functional operating system.

## Structure
The repository is organized into different stages, each representing a milestone in the course:

- **Logic Gates:** Contains the HDL code for NOT, AND, OR, and other gates.
- **Combinatorial Chips:** Implementation of Adders, ALUs, and more.
- **Sequential Chips:** Registers, RAM, and other sequential elements.
- **Assembler:** Translates assembly code to machine code.
- **VM Translator:** Translates VM code to assembly language.
- **Operating System:** Development of basic OS functionalities.

## Getting Started
Feel free to explore the code, review my progress, and provide any feedback. If you're also working on the course, let's learn and collaborate together!
