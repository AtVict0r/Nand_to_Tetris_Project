# Instructions to Design an 8-Way OR Gate

**Understand the 8-Way OR Gate:**

- First, make sure you understand the functionality of an 8-way OR gate. An 8-way OR gate is a digital logic gate that takes eight 1-bit inputs (in[7:0]) and produces a 1-bit output (out). The output bit is 1 if at least one of the input bits is 1; otherwise, it is 0.

**Use the OR Gate as Building Block:**

- Understand that you can use the basic 1-bit OR gate as the building block to implement the 8-way OR gate. The 1-bit OR gate takes two 1-bit inputs and produces a 1-bit output.

**Logic Expression for the 8-Way OR Gate:**

- The logic expression for the 8-way OR gate is as follows:

    out = in[7] OR in[6] OR in[5] OR in[4] OR in[3] OR in[2] OR in[1] OR in[0]

**Truth Table for the 8-Way OR Gate:**

- Create a truth table for the 8-way OR gate, considering all possible input combinations for the data inputs (in[7:0]). Since there are eight inputs, there will be 2^8 = 256 rows in the truth table. However, to make it more concise, the inputs can be grouped as follows:

    |  in[7:0] | out  |
    |-----------------|- 
    | 00000000 |  0   |
    | 00000001 |  1   |
    | 00000010 |  1   |
    | ...      |  ... |
    | 11111110 |  1   |
    | 11111111 |  1   |

**Implementing the 8-Way OR Gate using HDL:**

- Write the HDL code for the 8-way OR gate using the 1-bit OR gate as the building block. Declare the eight 1-bit data inputs (in[7:0]) and the 1-bit output (out) pin. Implement the 1-bit OR gate for each input bit and connect them accordingly.

    ```hdl
    CHIP Or8Way {
        IN in[8];
        OUT out;

        PARTS:
        Or(a=in[0], b=in[1], out=q0);
        Or(a=in[2], b=in[3], out=q1);
        Or(a=in[4], b=in[5], out=q2);
        Or(a=in[6], b=in[7], out=q3);
        Or(a=q0, b=q1, out=q4);
        Or(a=q2, b=q3, out=q5);
        Or(a=q4, b=q5, out=out);
    }
    ```

**Test the 8-Way OR Gate:**

- Before moving on to the next step, it's essential to test your 8-way OR gate implementation thoroughly. You can do this by using a hardware simulator or a hardware simulator provided by the Nand to Tetris software suite.
- Create test cases by setting different input (in[7:0]) combinations, and observe the corresponding output value (out). Verify that the 8-way OR gate produces the correct output based on the logic expression.

    ```hdl
    // Test script for the 8-way OR gate (Or8Way)
    // Test case 1: in = 00000000
    set in[7] 0
    set in[6] 0
    set in[5] 0
    set in[4] 0
    set in[3] 0
    set in[2] 0
    set in[1] 0
    set in[0] 0
    eval
    output out 0 // Expected output is 0

    // Test case 2: in = 11111111
    set in[7] 1
    set in[6] 1
    set in[5] 1
    set in[4] 1
    set in[3] 1
    set in[2] 1
    set in[1] 1
    set in[0] 1
    eval
    output out 1 // Expected output is 1

    // Test case 3: in = 01010101
    set in[7] 0
    set in[6] 1
    set in[5] 0
    set in[4] 1
    set in[3] 0
    set in[2] 1
    set in[1] 0
    set in[0] 1
    eval
    output out 1 // Expected output is 1

    // Test case 4: in = 10000000
    set in[7] 1
    set in[6] 0
    set in[5] 0
    set in[4] 0
    set in[3] 0
    set in[2] 0
    set in[1] 0
    set in[0] 0
    eval
    output out 1 // Expected output is 1

    // Test case 5: in = 00000001
    set in[7] 0
    set in[6] 0
    set in[5] 0
    set in[4] 0
    set in[3] 0
    set in[2] 0
    set in[1] 0
    set in[0] 1
    eval
    output out 1 // Expected output is 1
    ```

**Debugging:**

- Run the test script and compare the actual output (out) with the expected output based on the test cases. If there are any discrepancies, review your HDL code for errors or logic mistakes.
- Check the connections between the 1-bit OR gates and the output pin (out) to ensure they are correct for each input bit.

Once the 8-way OR gate (Or8Way) passes all test cases, you have successfully designed and implemented the 8-way OR gate using the 1-bit OR gate as the building block. Congratulations! You can continue exploring more complex circuits and logic designs in your Nand to Tetris journey. Keep up the great work!
