# Instructions to Design the XOR Gate

**Understand the XOR Gate:**

- First, make sure you understand the functionality of an XOR gate. The XOR (exclusive OR) gate is a basic digital logic gate that takes two inputs and produces an output that is true (1) if the inputs are different (one input is true and the other is false). Otherwise, the output is false (0).

**Use AND, OR, and NOT Gates:**

- Understand that you can use the AND, OR, and NOT gates as foundation building blocks to implement the XOR gate. You'll be combining these gates to create the XOR gate. The NOT gate has one input and one output, the AND gate has two inputs (A and B) and one output and the OR gate also has two inputs (A and B) and one output.

**XOR Logic Expression:**

- The XOR gate's logic expression is: XOR(A, B) = (A AND (NOT B)) OR ((NOT A) AND B). It means you can implement the XOR gate using the combination of AND, OR, and NOT gates as per the above expression.

**Truth Table for the XOR Gate:**

- Begin by creating a truth table for the XOR gate. List all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs. Since the XOR gate has two inputs (A and B), there will be four rows in the truth table.

    | Input A | Input B | Output |
    |---------|---------|--------|
    |    0    |    0    |   0    |
    |    0    |    1    |   1    |
    |    1    |    0    |   1    |
    |    1    |    1    |   0    |

**Implementing the XOR Gate using HDL:**

- Write the HDL code for the XOR gate using the AND, OR, and NOT gates as building blocks. Declare the input and output pins, implement the required gates as per the XOR logic expression, and connect them accordingly.

    ```hdl
    CHIP Xor {
        IN a, b;
        OUT out;

        PARTS:
        Not(in=b, out=notB);
        And(a=a, b=notB, out=aAndNotB);

        Not(in=a, out=notA);
        And(a=notA, b=b, out=notAAndB);

        Or(a=aAndNotB, b=notAAndB, out=out);
    }
    ```

**Test the XOR Gate:**

- Before moving on to the next step, it's essential to test your XOR gate implementation thoroughly. You can do this by using a hardware simulator or a hardware simulator provided by the Nand to Tetris software suite.
- Create test cases for all possible input combinations (00, 01, 10, and 11) and observe the outputs. Verify that the XOR gate produces the correct output based on the truth table.

    ```
    // Test script for the XOR gate
    // Test case 1: Input A=0, Input B=0
    set a 0
    set b 0
    eval
    output 0 // Expected output is 0

    // Test case 2: Input A=0, Input B=1
    set a 0
    set b 1
    eval
    output 1 // Expected output is 1

    // Test case 3: Input A=1, Input B=0
    set a 1
    set b 0
    eval
    output 1 // Expected output is 1

    // Test case 4: Input A=1, Input B=1
    set a 1
    set b 1
    eval
    output 0 // Expected output is 0
    ```

**Debugging:**

- Run the test script and compare the actual output with the expected output. If there are any discrepancies, review your HDL code for errors or logic mistakes.
- Check the connections between the gates to ensure they are correct as per the XOR logic expression.

Once the XOR gate passes all test cases, you have successfully designed and implemented the XOR gate using only the AND, OR, and NOT gates. Congratulations! Now, you have a XOR gate built from these basic logic gates. You can continue exploring more complex circuits and logic designs in your Nand to Tetris journey. Keep up the great work!
