# Instructions to Design the Mux16 Gate using Mux Gate

**Understand the Mux16 Gate:**

- First, make sure you understand the functionality of the Mux16 gate. The Mux16 gate is a digital logic gate that takes two 16-bit inputs (A and B), one 1-bit control input (sel), and produces a 16-bit output. The output is selected based on the control input (sel). If sel is 0 (false), the output will be the same as input A. If sel is 1 (true), the output will be the same as input B.

**Use the Mux Gate:**

- Understand that you can use the basic Mux gate as the building block to implement the Mux16 gate. The Mux gate has three inputs (a, b, and sel) and one output.

**Mux16 Logic Expression:**

- The Mux16 gate's logic expression is as follows:

  For each bit i in the 16-bit inputs A and B:

  out[i] = (A[i] AND NOT sel) OR (B[i] AND sel)

  It means that you can implement the Mux16 gate by performing the AND and NOT operations between each bit of the 16-bit input A and the control input sel, and the AND operation between each bit of the 16-bit input B and the control input sel. Finally, you perform an OR operation between the results of the AND and NOT operations and the AND operations.

**Implementing the Mux16 Gate using HDL:**

- Write the HDL code for the Mux16 gate using the Mux gate as the building block. Declare two 16-bit inputs (A and B), one 1-bit control input (sel), and one 16-bit output (out) pins. Implement the Mux gate for each bit of the inputs and connect them accordingly to achieve the Mux16 logic expression.

    ```hdl
    CHIP Mux16 {
        IN A[16], B[16], sel;
        OUT out[16];

        PARTS:
        Mux(a=A[0], b=B[0], sel=sel, out=out[0]);
        Mux(a=A[1], b=B[1], sel=sel, out=out[1]);
        // ...
        Mux(a=A[15], b=B[15], sel=sel, out=out[15]);
    }
    ```

**Test the Mux16 Gate:**

- Before moving on to the next step, it's essential to test your Mux16 gate implementation thoroughly. You can do this by using a hardware simulator or a hardware simulator provided by the Nand to Tetris software suite.
- Create test cases by setting different 16-bit inputs (A and B) and the control input (sel) and observe the corresponding 16-bit output (out). Verify that the Mux16 gate produces the correct output based on the control input.

    ```
    // Test script for the Mux16 gate
    // Test case 1: sel=0, Output should be same as input A
    set A[0..15] 1010101010101010
    set B[0..15] 1100110011001100
    set sel 0
    eval
    output out[0..15] 1010101010101010 // Expected output is same as input A

    // Test case 2: sel=1, Output should be same as input B
    set A[0..15] 1010101010101010
    set B[0..15] 1100110011001100
    set sel 1
    eval
    output out[0..15] 1100110011001100 // Expected output is same as input B

    // Test case 3: Random inputs
    set A[0..15] 0000000000000000
    set B[0..15] 1111111111111111
    set sel 1
    eval
    output out[0..15] 1111111111111111 // Expected output is same as input B
    ```

**Debugging:**

- Run the test script and compare the actual output (out) with the expected output based on the test cases. If there are any discrepancies, review your HDL code for errors or logic mistakes.
- Check the connection between the Mux gate inputs (a, b, and sel) and the output (out) to ensure they are correct for each bit of the 16-bit inputs.

Once the Mux16 gate passes all test cases, you have successfully designed and implemented the Mux16 gate using the Mux gate. Great job! Now, you can continue exploring more complex circuits and logic designs in your Nand to Tetris journey. Keep up the fantastic work!
