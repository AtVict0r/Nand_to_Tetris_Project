# Instructions to Design the Not16 Gate

**Understand the Not16 Gate:**

- First, make sure you understand the functionality of the Not16 gate. The Not16 gate is a digital logic gate that takes a 16-bit input and produces a 16-bit output, where each bit of the output is the complement (negation) of the corresponding bit in the input.

**Use the Not Gate:**

- Understand that you can use the basic Not gate as the building block to implement the Not16 gate. The Not gate has one input and one output.

**Not16 Logic Expression:**

- The Not16 gate's logic expression is as follows:

  out[0] = NOT in[0]
  out[1] = NOT in[1]
  ...
  out[15] = NOT in[15]

  It means that you can implement the Not16 gate by applying the Not gate to each bit of the 16-bit input individually.

**Implementing the Not16 Gate using HDL:**

- Write the HDL code for the Not16 gate using the Not gate as the building block. Declare the 16-bit input (in) and 16-bit output (out) pins, implement the Not gate for each bit of the input, and connect them accordingly.

    ```hdl
    CHIP Not16 {
        IN in[16];
        OUT out[16];

        PARTS:
        Not(in=in[0], out=out[0]);
        Not(in=in[1], out=out[1]);
        // ...
        Not(in=in[15], out=out[15]);
    }
    ```

**Test the Not16 Gate:**

- Before moving on to the next step, it's essential to test your Not16 gate implementation thoroughly. You can do this by using a hardware simulator or a hardware simulator provided by the Nand to Tetris software suite.
- Create test cases by setting different 16-bit inputs (in) and observe the corresponding 16-bit outputs (out). Verify that the Not16 gate produces the correct complemented output for each bit of the input.

    ```
    // Test script for the Not16 gate
    // Test case 1: Input all 0s
    set in[0..15] 0000000000000000
    eval
    output out[0..15] 1111111111111111 // Expected output is all 1s

    // Test case 2: Input all 1s
    set in[0..15] 1111111111111111
    eval
    output out[0..15] 0000000000000000 // Expected output is all 0s

    // Test case 3: Random input
    set in[0..15] 1010101010101010
    eval
    output out[0..15] 0101010101010101 // Expected output is complemented input
    ```

**Debugging:**

- Run the test script and compare the actual outputs (out) with the expected outputs based on the test cases. If there are any discrepancies, review your HDL code for errors or logic mistakes.
- Check the connection between the Not gate inputs and outputs to ensure they are correct for each bit of the 16-bit input.

Once the Not16 gate passes all test cases, you have successfully designed and implemented the Not16 gate using the Not gate. Well done! Now, you can move on to designing more complex circuits and logic designs in your Nand to Tetris journey. Keep up the excellent work!
