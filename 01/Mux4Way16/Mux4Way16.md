# Instructions to Design a 4-Way 16-Bit Multiplexer (Mux4Way16)

**Understand the 4-Way 16-Bit Multiplexer (Mux4Way16):**

- First, make sure you understand the functionality of a 4-way 16-bit multiplexer (Mux4Way16). A multiplexer takes multiple inputs and selects one of them as the output based on the control inputs. In this case, the 4-way 16-bit multiplexer has four 16-bit data inputs (a, b, c, and d) and two 1-bit control inputs (sel[1] and sel[0]). It has one 16-bit output (out), and based on the control inputs, one of the data inputs will be directed to the output.

**Use the Mux16 Gate:**

- Understand that you can use the Mux16 gate as the building block to implement the 4-way 16-bit multiplexer. The Mux16 gate takes two 16-bit data inputs and a 1-bit control input and produces a 16-bit output.

**Logic Expression for the 4-Way Mux16:**

- The logic expression for the 4-way 16-bit multiplexer is as follows:

    out = (NOT sel[1] AND NOT sel[0] AND a) OR (NOT sel[1] AND sel[0] AND b) OR (sel[1] AND NOT sel[0] AND c) OR (sel[1] AND sel[0] AND d)

**Truth Table for the 4-Way Mux16:**

- Create a truth table for the 4-way 16-bit multiplexer, considering all possible input combinations for the data inputs (a, b, c, and d) and control inputs (sel[1], sel[0]). Since there are two control inputs, there will be four rows in the truth table.

    | sel[1] | sel[0] | out[15:0] |
    |--------|--------|-----------|
    |   0    |   0    |  a[15:0]  |
    |   0    |   1    |  b[15:0]  | 
    |   1    |   0    |  c[15:0]  |
    |   1    |   1    |  d[15:0]  |

**Implementing the 4-Way Mux16 using HDL:**

- Write the HDL code for the 4-way 16-bit multiplexer using the Mux16 gate as the building block. Declare the 16-bit data inputs (a, b, c, and d), 1-bit control inputs (sel[1], sel[0]), and the 16-bit output (out) pins. Implement the Mux16 gate for each output line and connect them accordingly based on the control inputs.

    ```hdl
    CHIP Mux4Way16 {
        IN a[16], b[16], c[16], d[16], sel[2];
        OUT out[16];

        PARTS:
        Mux16(a=a, b=b, sel=sel[0], out=q);
        Mux16(a=c, b=d, sel=sel[0], out=r);
        Mux16(a=q, b=r, sel=sel[1], out=out);
    }
    ```

**Test the 4-Way Mux16:**

- Before moving on to the next step, it's essential to test your 4-way 16-bit multiplexer implementation thoroughly. You can do this by using a hardware simulator or a hardware simulator provided by the Nand to Tetris software suite.
- Create test cases by setting different data inputs (a, b, c, and d) and control inputs (sel[1], sel[0]) combinations, and observe the corresponding output values (out). Verify that the 4-way 16-bit multiplexer produces the correct output based on the control inputs.

    ```

**Debugging:**

- Run the test script and compare the actual outputs (out) with the expected outputs based on the test cases. If there are any discrepancies, review your HDL code for errors or logic mistakes.
- Check the connection between the Mux16 gate
