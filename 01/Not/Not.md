# Instructions to Design the NOT Gate

**Understand the NOT Gate:**

- First, make sure you understand the functionality of a NOT gate. The NOT gate is a basic digital logic gate that takes a single input and produces the opposite output. If the input is 0, the output is 1, and vice versa.

**Use the Nand Gate:**

- Understand that the Nand gate is a universal gate, meaning it can be used as a foundation to create any other logic gate, including the NOT gate. You'll use the Nand gate as the building block to create the NOT gate. The Nand gate has two inputs, A and B, and one output.

**NOT Logic Expression:**

- The NOT gate's logic expression is: NOT(A) = A NAND A. It states that you can implement the NOT gate by connecting the same input to both inputs of a Nand gate.

**Truth Table for the NOT Gate:**

- Begin by creating a truth table for the NOT gate. List all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs. Since the NOT gate has one input, there will be two rows in the truth table (one for input 0 and one for input 1).

    | Input (A) | Output |
    |-----------|--------|
    |    0      |   1    |
    |    1      |   0    |

**Implementing the NOT Gate using HDL:**

- Write the HDL code for the NOT gate using the Nand gate as the building block. Declare the input and output pins and then implement the connection between the Nand gate inputs and the single input of the NOT gate. Remember that you can use a Nand gate to implement a NOT gate by connecting one input of the Nand gate to both of its inputs.

    ```hdl
    CHIP Not {
        IN in;
        OUT out;

        PARTS:
        Nand(a=in, b=in, out=out);
    }
    ```

**Test the NOT Gate:**

- Before moving on to the next step, it's essential to test your NOT gate implementation thoroughly. You can do this by using a hardware simulator or a hardware simulator provided by the Nand to Tetris software suite.
- Create test cases for all possible input combinations (0 and 1) and observe the outputs. Verify that the NOT gate produces the correct output based on the truth table.

    ```
    // Test script for the NOT gate
    // Test case 1: Input 0
    set in 0
    eval
    output 1 // Expected output is 1

    // Test case 2: Input 1
    set in 1
    eval
    output 0 // Expected output is 0
    ```

**Debugging:**

- Run the test script and compare the actual output with the expected output. If there are any discrepancies, review your HDL code for errors or logic mistakes.
- Check the connection between the Nand gate inputs and the NOT gate input to ensure they are correct.

Once the NOT gate passes all test cases, you have successfully designed and implemented the NOT gate using the Nand gate. Congratulations!  Now, you can move on to designing other logic gates, such as the AND, OR, and XOR gates, using the Nand gate as the building block. Good luck with your Nand to Tetris journey!
