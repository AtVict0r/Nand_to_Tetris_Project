# Instructions to Design the OR Gate

**Understand the OR Gate:**

- First, make sure you understand the functionality of an OR gate. The OR gate is a basic digital logic gate that takes two inputs and produces an output that is true (1) if at least one of the inputs is true (1). Otherwise, the output is false (0).

**Use the Nand and Not Gates:**

- Understand that you can use the Nand and Not gates as foundation building blocks to implement the OR gate. You'll be combining these gates to create the OR gate. The NOT gate has one input and one output, while the NAND gate has two inputs (A and B) and one output.

**OR Logic Expression:**

- The OR gate's logic expression is: OR(A, B) = NAND(NOT A, NOT B). It states that you can implement the OR gate by negating both inputs of a Nand gate.

**Truth Table for the OR Gate:**

- Begin by creating a truth table for the OR gate. List all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs. Since the OR gate has two inputs (A and B), there will be four rows in the truth table.

    | Input A | Input B | Output |
    |---------|---------|--------|
    |    0    |    0    |   0    |
    |    0    |    1    |   1    |
    |    1    |    0    |   1    |
    |    1    |    1    |   1    |

**Implementing the OR Gate using HDL:**

- Write the HDL code for the OR gate using the Nand and Not gates as building blocks. Declare the input and output pins, implement the Not gates for both inputs, and then apply the Nand gate to the outputs of the Not gates.

    ```hdl
    CHIP Or {
        IN a, b;
        OUT out;

        PARTS:
        Not(in=a, out=na);
        Not(in=b, out=nb);
        Nand(a=na, b=nb, out=out);
    }
    ```

**Test the OR Gate:**

- Before moving on to the next step, it's essential to test your OR gate implementation thoroughly. You can do this by using a hardware simulator or a hardware simulator provided by the Nand to Tetris software suite.
- Create test cases for all possible input combinations (00, 01, 10, and 11) and observe the outputs. Verify that the OR gate produces the correct output based on the truth table.

    ```
    // Test script for the OR gate
    // Test case 1: Input A=0, Input B=0
    set a 0
    set b 0
    eval
    output 0 // Expected output is 0

    // Test case 2: Input A=0, Input B=1
    set a 0
    set b 1
    eval
    output 1 // Expected output is 1

    // Test case 3: Input A=1, Input B=0
    set a 1
    set b 0
    eval
    output 1 // Expected output is 1

    // Test case 4: Input A=1, Input B=1
    set a 1
    set b 1
    eval
    output 1 // Expected output is 1
    ```

**Debugging:**

- Run the test script and compare the actual output with the expected output. If there are any discrepancies, review your HDL code for errors or logic mistakes.
- Check the connection between the Not gates' outputs and the Nand gate input to ensure they are correct.

Once the OR gate passes all test cases, you have successfully designed and implemented the OR gate using the Nand and Not gates. Congratulations! Now, you can move on to designing other logic gates and continue exploring more complex circuits in your Nand to Tetris journey! Keep up the excellent work!
