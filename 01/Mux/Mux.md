# Instructions to Design the Mux Gate

**Understand the Mux Gate:**

- First, make sure you understand the functionality of a Mux (Multiplexer) gate. The Mux gate is a digital logic gate that takes three inputs: two data inputs (A and B) and one control input (C). It produces an output that is equal to A when C is 0 (false) and equal to B when C is 1 (true).

**Use AND, OR, and NOT Gates:**

- Understand that you can use the AND, OR, and NOT gates as foundation building blocks to implement the Mux gate. You'll be combining these gates to create the Mux gate. The NOT gate has one input and one output, the AND gate has two inputs (A and B) and one output and the OR gate also has two inputs (A and B) and one output.

**Mux Logic Expression:**

- The Mux gate's logic expression is: MUX(A, B, C) = (A AND (NOT C)) OR (B AND C). It means you can implement the Mux gate using the combination of AND, OR, and NOT gates as per the above expression.

**Truth Table for the Mux Gate:**

- Begin by creating a truth table for the Mux gate. List all possible input combinations and their corresponding outputs. Since the Mux gate has two data inputs (A and B) and one control input (C), there will be eight rows in the truth table.

    | Input A | Input B | Control C | Output |
    |---------|---------|-----------|--------|
    |    0    |    1    |     0     |   0    |
    |    1    |    0    |     0     |   1    |
    |    0    |    1    |     1     |   1    |
    |    1    |    0    |     1     |   0    |

**Implementing the Mux Gate using HDL:**

- Write the HDL code for the Mux gate using the AND, OR, and NOT gates as building blocks. Declare the input and output pins, implement the required gates as per the Mux logic expression, and connect them accordingly.

    ```hdl
    CHIP Mux {
        IN a, b, c;
        OUT out;

        PARTS:
        Not(in=c, out=notC);
        And(a=a, b=notC, out=aAndNotC);
        And(a=b, b=c, out=bAndC);
        Or(a=aAndNotC, b=bAndC, out=out);
    }
    ```

**Test the Mux Gate:**

- Before moving on to the next step, it's essential to test your Mux gate implementation thoroughly. You can do this by using a hardware simulator or a hardware simulator provided by the Nand to Tetris software suite.
- Create test cases for all possible input combinations (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, and 111) and observe the outputs. Verify that the Mux gate produces the correct output based on the truth table.

    ```
    // Test script for the Mux gate
    // Test case 1: Input A=0, Input B=0, Control C=0
    set a 0
    set b 0
    set c 0
    eval
    output 0 // Expected output is 0

    // Test case 2: Input A=0, Input B=0, Control C=1
    set a 0
    set b 0
    set c 1
    eval
    output 0 // Expected output is 0

    // Test case 3: Input A=0, Input B=1, Control C=0
    set a 0
    set b 1
    set c 0
    eval
    output 0 // Expected output is 0

    // Test case 4: Input A=0, Input B=1, Control C=1
    set a 0
    set b 1
    set c 1
    eval
    output 1 // Expected output is 1

    // Test case 5: Input A=1, Input B=0, Control C=0
    set a 1
    set b 0
    set c 0
    eval
    output 1 // Expected output is 1

    // Test case 6: Input A=1, Input B=0, Control C=1
    set a 1
    set b 0
    set c 1
    eval
    output 0 // Expected output is 0

    // Test case 7: Input A=1, Input B=1, Control C=0
    set a 1
    set b 1
    set c 0
    eval
    output 1 // Expected output is 1

    // Test case 8: Input A=1, Input B=1, Control C=1
    set a 1
    set b 1
    set c 1
    eval
    output 1 // Expected output is 1
    ```

**Debugging:**

- Run the test script and compare the actual output with the expected output. If there are any discrepancies, review your HDL code for errors or logic mistakes.
- Check the connections between the gates to ensure they are correct as per the Mux logic expression.

Once the Mux gate passes all test cases, you have successfully designed and implemented the Mux gate using only the AND, OR, and NOT gates. Congratulations! Now, you have a Mux gate built from these basic logic gates. You can continue exploring more complex circuits and logic designs in your Nand to Tetris journey. Keep up the great work!
